# RuntimePermission
Runtime permission
***JK***
This application asks the user to grant permissions (Contacts & Settings) at runtime.
If the user denies to grant any one of these permissions at runtime, a snackbar (with INDEFINITE TIME INTERVAL) appears at the bottom of the screen with an "UNDO" option.
If the user clicks the "UNDO" option, it will take the user to the "Settings" -> "Apps" -> "App Name i.e., RuntimePermission" ; where, the user can click "Permissions" to view the permissions which he has granted/denied & he can change his decision there ..
If the user grants all these permissions, it will take him back to the applicaiton main page, with a toast maessage "Permission Granted"
